# Simon Game

A Simon Game coded with jQuery


## History
This Simon Game shows a random sequence of colours/sounds that need to be correctly followed by the user. Ever time the user misses the right sequence, the game will show the correct sequence again. 
If played in the Strict Mode, user will have only 1 chance to hit the right sequence, any error will restart the game.
At every correct entry the counter adds 1 point to the user, when it reaches the count of 20 user wins the game.
